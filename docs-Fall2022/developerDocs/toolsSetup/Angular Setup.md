**Before starting be sure to have Node.js and npm package manager installed first.

Within the project folder do the following:
1. Install Angular CLI using `npm install -g @angular/cli`
Note: Some Windows system require PowerShell scripts to be enabled, use `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`
2. You now have the Angular CLI tool installed, use `ng serve --opem` to view the project in your default web browser
