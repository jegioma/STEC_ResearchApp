## **Description/About**

For our Software Development II project, we have chosen to work on the Research App web application. Its main purpose is to help students in finding a research project of their liking and sign up for them using online forms. These projects can be created and edited by GGC faculty and the STEC coordinator. Both can also view, search, and filter out submitted/in progress forms with the coordinator having more control in the app like having access to all forms and the ability to accept, deny, and delete any form.

**Working Features**
1. Login using Firebase(BaaS) to Authenticate Users
2. Form data is being collected as a form object
3. A backend is built with MongoDB and Node.js found in the backend folder

**Features To Be Implemented**
1. The backend needs to be deployed and connected to the web app or another solution found to save form data
2. An Admin dashboard needs to be created that would allow the STEC Coordinator to:
   * Add/Delete/Edit forms
   * Search for completed forms
   * Notify when a form is submitted
3. Form validation needs to be added to the forms to control user data entry
4. Form validation needs to be added to the registration component
5. A password reset component should be added
6. A component for students and faculty to search and edit forms
